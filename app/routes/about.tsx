						<h2>The story so far</h2>
						<h3>The beginning</h3>
						<p>
							I started my tech career after leaving school, working in QA at a
							local company. They were super supportive and gave me the time and
							space to play with code, which meant I was eventually able to
							start working as a developer on some of their products.
						</p>
						<p>
							From there, I freelanced in London for a few years, working on
							some really varied projects - from local authorities, to wealth
							management, to radio streaming. I learnt so much during this time,
							about how to build good software but also about how to work
							effectively in a team.
						</p>
						<p>
							Freelancing often means being thrown in at the deep end - joining
							a new team and delivering work on a short timescale. It was pretty
							intense at times, but it was an invaluable experience.
						</p>
						<h3>The middle bit</h3>
						<p>
							I took a permanent role as Lead UI Engineer at a PropTech company
							called Coyote Software. There, I led the front end development of
							the product, and managed a team of three other engineers. It was a
							steep learning curve, but I absolutely loved it and learnt a lot
							about working with and managing a team.
						</p>

							className="not-prose rounded-3xl"
						/>
						<h3>Today</h3>
						<p>
							I'm currently a Software Engineer and Tech Lead at Pleo, in the
							Core Experience team. We work with all the feature teams to ensure
							we build a consistently great user experience across the product,
							focusing on getting the details right. Pleo is a great place to
							work, and it's beena a great experience callaborating across a big
							engineering department, driving complex multi-dependency projects
							forward.
