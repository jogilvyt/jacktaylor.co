As a sighted user browsing the web, it's usually pretty easy to scan a page and
quickly get an idea of where the content you're looking for is. But for users
who rely on a screenreader, this isn't possible. A screenreader user needs to
navigate through the whole page sequentially until they find the relevant
content, and this can be a slow and frustrating process.

Thankfully, it's possible to make this process easier by using landmark regions.
These are roles which are exposed to screenreaders to help them understand the
structure of a page, telling them where each section of content is and what it
contains.

## Interactive tool

I've created an interactive tool to help sighted users visualise how landmark
regions work. The idea is to highlight how important visual hierarchy and layout
are for helping users navigate around a page.

Take a look at the simulated page below. Without any visual hierarchy, sighted
users will see a jumble of elements, with no clear idea of what content each
section contains. But as you toggle the landmark regions on, you'll see how the
page layout becomes more structured, and you'll instinctively know where to look
for different types of content, as well as what you'd expect to find there.

Landmark regions help to provide a similar structure for screenreader users,
making it easier for them to navigate the page and find the content they're
looking for. With the appropriate landmark regions added to a page, a
screenreader will explicitly announce each section of the page, so a user can
quickly jump to the content they're interested in.

## Core landmark regions

There are a few core landmark regions which you should aim to always include on
your page. These are all exposed by default by the relevant semantic HTML
element, so using the right element will get you most of the way there.

### Banner

The `banner` landmark region normally appears at the top of a page and contains
global, site-oriented content, such as a company logo, navigation and search.
There should only be one banner per page. The `header` HTML element exposes the
banner role by default.

```html
<header>
	<!-- banner content goes here -->
</header>
```

### Navigation

The `navigation` landmark region is used to identify a collection of links used
for navigating the site. If you have more than one navigation region (for
example in the header and the footer), you should give each one an accessible
name using the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute. The `nav` HTML
element exposes the navigation role by default.

```html
<nav aria-labelledby="nav-name">
	<p id="nav-name">Site</p>
	<!-- navigation links go here -->
</nav>
```

<Callout>
	Screenreaders will append 'navigation' to the accessible name of the
	`navigation` landmark region, so you don't need to include it in the
	accessible name yourself. In the example above, a screenreader will annouce
	"Site navigation".
</Callout>

### Main

The `main` landmark region is used to identify the primary content of the page.
There should only be one main region per page, as a direct child of the body.
The `main` HTML element exposes the main role by default.

```html
<main>
	<!-- main content goes here -->
</main>
```

### Complementary

The `complementary` landmark region is used to identify secondary content that
complements (but is not essential to) the main content, such as a sidebar or a
group of related links. If you have more than one complementary region, you
should give each one an accessible name using the `aria-label` or
`aria-labelledby` attribute. The `aside` HTML element exposes the complementary
role by default.

```html
<aside aria-labelledby="complementary-name">
	<p id="complementary-name">Related links</p>
	<!-- complementary content goes here -->
</aside>
```

### Contentinfo

The `contentinfo` landmark region is normally rendered as the site footer, and
is used to identify information about the page content which is normally
repeated across pages, such as copyright, privacy information, or contact
details. There should only be one `contentinfo` region per page. The `footer`
HTML element exposes the `contentinfo` role by default.

```html
<footer>
	<!-- contentinfo content goes here -->
</footer>
```

## Other landmark regions

In addition to the core landmark regions, there are a few others which can be
useful to screenreader users.

### Form

The `form` landmark region is used to identify a group of form elements. The
HTML `<form>` element will be assigned the `form` role if it has an accessible
name given to it through an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute.

Generally, you don't need to use the `form` landmark region unless it is a
particularly significant area of the page, and no other landmark region is
appropriate (e.g. `main` or `search`).

```html
<form role="form" aria-labelledby="form-name">
	<p id="form-name">Your form</p>
	<!-- form elements go here -->
</form>
```

### Search

The `search` landmark region is used to identify a section of the page which
provides some sort of search functionality. This is usually a search form or
search input field.

The `search` HTML element exposes the `search` role by default, though this
doesn't have full cross-browser support yet, so it's a good idea to still assign
the `search` role manually
([special thanks to Sara Soueidan for pointing this out!](https://x.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1795481651885343077)).

```html
<search role="search" aria-labelledby="search-name">
	<p id="search-name">Search this site</p>
	<!-- search form elements go here -->
</search>
```

### Generic regions

If none of the other landmark regions are appropriate for a section of the page,
you can use the `region` role to define a generic region.

`<section>` elements will be automatically assigned the `region` role, but only
if they provide an accessible name using an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
attribute. A `<section>` element without an accessible name will not be treated
as a landmark region. The accessible name you provide will be used to identify
which type of content a user can expect to find in that region. In the same way
that a screenreader user should know what to expect from a "navigation" region,
they should be able to know what they'll find in your generic region.

An example of a use case for a generic region might be something like an online
code editor, where you want to distinguish the area where the code is written
and the area where the output is displayed. These don't fall into any of the
existing landmark regions, so a generic region with a descriptive name would be
a good choice here.

```html
<section aria-labelledby="region-name">
	<p id="region-name">Your region</p>
	<!-- region content goes here -->
</section>
```

## Use landmark regions sparingly

Ideally, landmark regions should be used sparingly. As a sighted user, a page
with an over-complicated visual hierarchy or too many visual landmarks can be
overwhelming. The same is true for screenreader users. Too many landmark regions
can end up making a page more difficult to navigate, and ultimately result in a
worse user experience.

Generally, it's best to include the core landmark regions that you have on your
page (`banner`, `navigation`, `main`, `complementary`, `contentinfo`) and only
add additional landmark regions when you're sure they'll add value.

## Conclusion

As a sighted user, building interfaces that work for screenreader users doesn't
always feel intuitive. But tools like the interactive example above have helped
me to better understand what it might be like for people using assistive
technologies to interact with the web. I hope it's been helpful for you too!
