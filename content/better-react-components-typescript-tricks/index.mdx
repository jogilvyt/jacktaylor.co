I often run into cases where I want to be super explicit about what props should
be provided to a React component. Sometimes this is because the component needs
certain props across different types of data, or because I want to be explicit
about what _combination_ of props should be provided. Luckily, TypeScript has
some great features that allow us to cater for these situations whilst also
providing a nice robust API surface for our component.

## Discriminated unions

A discriminated union (sometimes also called a 'tagged union') allows you to
define multiple different types, with one property shared across them that
defines which type is in use.

That's pretty wordy, so let's have a look at an example. Say we have a list of
books and films, and we want to use a React component to render a label for each
item in this list. Both books and films have a title, but books have an author,
and films have a director. You could do it like this:

```tsx
interface MediaLabelProps {
	title: string
	author?: string
	director?: string
}

function MediaLabel(props: MediaLabelProps) {
	const isFilm = props.director && !props.author
	const isBook = props.author && !props.director

	if (isFilm) {
		return (
			<>
				{props.title} - {props.director}
			</>
		)
	}

	if (isBook) {
		return (
			<>
				{props.title} - {props.author}
			</>
		)
	}

	return null
}
```

However, this allows you to get into some potentially weird states:

```tsx
  // TypeScript is happy, but this would render null
  <MediaLabel
    title="The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"
    author="J. R. R. Tolkein"
    director="Peter Jackson"
  />

  // TypeScript is also fine with this, but we really
  // want to make sure either an author or a director is passed
  <MediaLabel title="The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" />
```

We can be more explicit using a discriminated union:

```tsx
interface MediaItem {
	title: string
}

interface Film extends MediaItem {
	type: 'film'
	director: string
}

interface Book extends MediaItem {
	type: 'book'
	author: string
}

type MediaLabelProps = Book | Film

function MediaLabel(props: MediaLabelProps) {
	if (props.type === 'book') {
		return (
			<>
				{props.title} - {props.author}
			</>
		)
	}

	if (props.type === 'film') {
		return (
			<>
				{props.title} - {props.director}
			</>
		)
	}

	return null
}
```

Both `Film` and `Book` share the `title` property, so they both extend the
`MediaItem` interface. But they also have a `type` property that is unique to
each type. This is the 'discriminant' property, and inside the `MediaLabel`
component we can use it to tell TypeScript exactly which type we're dealing
with.

<Callout>
	Note that TypeScript won't let you destructure the `props` object in the
	function parameters if you're using a discriminated union. If you think about
	it, it makes sense - you can't know what properties are available until you've
	checked which `type` is being passed. So you'll need to access the properties
	directly from the `props` object, like in the example above.
</Callout>

The true power of this becomes apparent when you use the component:

```tsx
// TypeScript will complain if you try to pass both an author and a director
<MediaLabel
  title="The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"
  author="J. R. R. Tolkein"
  director="Peter Jackson"
/>

// TypeScript will also complain if you don't pass an author or a director at all
<MediaLabel title="The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" />
```

This way we can be super explicit about what props our `MediaLabel` component
expects. Nice! ðŸŽ‰

## "Exclusive or" (XOR) Props

Another common use case I come across is when a component should to take one OR
another prop, but not both. We can do this using an "exclusive or" type.

As an example, let's say we have a dialog component and we want to ensure that
either an `aria-label` or an `aria-labelledby` is passed as a prop. You could do
this:

```tsx
interface DialogProps {
	children: React.ReactNode
	'aria-label'?: string
	'aria-labelledby'?: string
}

function Dialog({ children, ...props }: DialogProps) {
	return (
		<div role="dialog" {...props}>
			{props.children}
		</div>
	)
}
```

However, this would mean you could pass both an `aria-label` and an
`aria-labelledby` - or neither:

```tsx
// TypeScript is happy, but this would render with both an `aria-label` and an `aria-labelledby`
<Dialog aria-label="This is a dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title">Hello, world!</Dialog>

// TypeScript is also fine with this, but really we want to ensure that
// either an `aria-label` or an `aria-labelledby` is passed
<Dialog>Hello, world!</Dialog>
```

Instead, you can enforce that either an `aria-label` OR an `aria-labelledby` is
passed by doing this:

```tsx
interface DialogBaseProps {
	children: React.ReactNode
}

interface DialogWithAriaLabel extends DialogBaseProps {
	'aria-label': string
	'aria-labelledby'?: never
}

interface DialogWithAriaLabelledBy extends DialogBaseProps {
	'aria-label'?: never
	'aria-labelledby': string
}

type DialogProps = DialogWithAriaLabel | DialogWithAriaLabelledBy

function Dialog({ children, ...props }: DialogProps) {
	return (
		<div role="dialog" {...props}>
			{children}
		</div>
	)
}
```

Now when we render the `Dialog` component, TypeScript will complain if we try to
pass both an `aria-label` and an `aria-labelledby`, or if we don't pass either:

```tsx
// TypeScript will complain if you try to pass both an `aria-label` and an `aria-labelledby`
<Dialog aria-label="This is a dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title">Hello, world!</Dialog>

// TypeScript will also complain if you don't pass an `aria-label` or an `aria-labelledby` at all
<Dialog>Hello, world!</Dialog>
```

Again, this allows you to be super explicit about how your component is meant to
be used âœ…

## Conclusion

A component with a good API surface should show other developers how to use it
without them needing to check how that component was implemented under the hood.
Using these TypeScript features allows you to make your code self-documenting by
being explicit about what props your components are expecting. It's a win-win -
for the experience of the other developers using your component, and for the
robustness of the component itself.
