In the past, full page view transitions have always been a bit of a nightmare to
build. With single page apps (SPAs), we've had to work around router
limitations, and with multi-page apps, it's been impossible.

But now we have the shiny new
[View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API),
which lets the browser handle the difficult bits when transitioning between
views, whilst giving us the tools to customise the animations to our hearts'
content.

Building my new website gave me an opportunity to have a play around with the
View Transitions API myself. The site is open source, so you can jump straight
in and [look at the complete code](https://github.com/jogilvyt/jacktaylor.co) if
you want to. My website uses Remix, which abstracts some of the work away for
me, but I'll try and explain any fundamental concepts along the way too so you
can apply this to any framework.

## Browser support

An important note before we start - this is still an experimental API, and at
the time of writing it's not available in all modern browsers yet. It's worth
checking the
[browser compatibility table on the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API#browser_compatibility)
before starting to make sure you're ok with the current level of support.

For me, this was an opportunity to learn the new API whilst adding a bit of ✨
magic ✨ to my website, so full cross-browser support wasn't essential. If it is
a requirement for you, it's probably worth using something like
[framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/) with
[react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), which should allow you to at
least create transitions between the pages in your app.

With all that said, let's get stuck in.

## A basic crossfade animation

If you're using `react-router` (or Remix, which is heavily integrated with
`react-router`), you can enable basic view transitions by adding the
`unstable_viewTransition` prop to your `Link` or `NavLink` components:

```tsx
<Link {...props} unstable_viewTransition />
```

If you're not using `react-router`, you'll need to do a bit more work to enable
view transitions. Wherever you're handling navigation between pages, you'll need
to add something like this:

```js
function yourNavigationFunction(data) {
	// Fallback for browsers that don't support the View Transitions API
	if (!document.startViewTransition) {
		doYourNavigation(data)
		return
	}

	// With a transition
	document.startViewTransition(() => doYourNavigation(data))
}
```

And that's it! You should now see a nice crossfade between your pages. This is
the browser default, and can be customised (and we will be doing that soon), but
it blows my mind how easy this is.

<Callout>
	If you're planning to add transitions between all the pages on your app, it
	might make sense to create a custom `Link` component with the prop applied by
	default, and use that instead of the Remix `Link`. [This is what I did for my
	website](https://github.com/jogilvyt/jacktaylor.co/blob/main/app/components/transition-links.tsx).
</Callout>

## Customising the transitions

Ok, so we have a basic crossfade animation which looks great and was super easy
to implement. But as engineers we always want to tweak things, so let's have a
look at how we can customise the transitions between pages a bit.

In most apps there are elements which are present on every page, like the
navigation. It doesn't really make sense to fade this out and back in again
every time we load a new page. There might also be elements that exist on two
separate pages, but are visually slightly different. For example, on this
website, the blog listing page has a list of blog posts as cards, and when you
click on one, you see the same blog title and image scaled up to fill the width
of the page.

It's possible to tell the View Transitions API that these are the same elements,
and it will automatically animate changes in size and position of the elements
between pages for us. You do this using the `view-transition-name` CSS property.
The value of this property needs to be a unique name, and it needs to be present
on each instance of the element which should animate between pages.

You can add this directly to the `style` attribute of the elements you want to
connect, or you can add a class name with this property and add the class to
both elements:

```css
.your-view-transition-class {
	view-transition-name: your-view-transition-name;
}
```

If you're using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), unfortunately there's not
yet support for adding `view-transition-name` as an arbitrary value.
[There's a feature request for it](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/11669),
but until then you can add a custom component class name with the property
applied, which is
[what I ended up doing](https://github.com/jogilvyt/jacktaylor.co/blob/dev/app/styles/tailwind.css#L110):

```css
@layer components {
	.your-view-transition-class {
		view-transition-name: your-view-transition-name;
	}
}
```

With this applied to the navigation on my site, you can see that the navigation
no longer fades out and back in between when changing pages:

	src="/images/blog-images/crossfade-animation.gif"
	firstFrameSrc="/images/blog-images/crossfade-animation-first-frame.gif"
	alt="A crossfade animation between two pages, where the navigation doesn't animate"
/>

And when I added a `view-transition-name` to the image and title on both the
blog card and blog post page, the browser automatically handles transitioning
the size and position of them for me:

<GifPlayer
	src="/images/blog-images/view-transition.gif"
	firstFrameSrc="/images/blog-images/view-transition-first-frame.gif"
	alt="The browser automatically animating the size and position of the blog title and image between two pages"
/>

## More customisation

The animations that the browser provides by default are pretty nice, but it's
also possible to customise them further if we want to.

Under the hood, the View Transitions API works by building a tree of pseudo
elements - one for the old page that the user is navigating away from, and one
for the new page that is being navigated to. These pseudo elements sit on top of
the whole document, so the page underneath is no longer visible. The elements of
the old tree are then faded out, and the new elements faded in - this is the
default crossfade that we started with. The pseudo element tree looks something
like this:

```
::view-transition
└─ ::view-transition-group(root)
   └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(root)
      ├─ ::view-transition-old(root)
      └─ ::view-transition-new(root)
```

Because these are all HTML pseudo elements, we can target them using CSS and
apply our own animation CSS properties. For example, we can change the default
animation duration like this:

```css
@supports (view-transition-name: none) {
	::view-transition-old(root) {
		animation-duration: 100ms;
	}
}
```

<Callout>
	The `@supports (view-transition-name: none)` CSS at-rule ensures that the
	stlyes are only applied if the browser supports the View Transitions API
</Callout>

It's also possible to target specific transitions using the
`view-transition-name` you defined for that element:

```css
@supports (view-transition-name: none) {
	::view-transition-group(your-view-transition-name) {
		animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.61, 0.355, 1);
		animation-duration: 300ms;
		/* ...and any other properties you might want to add here */
	}
}
```

You can go as wild as you want here - it's possible to do anything you can do
with CSS animations. Have fun!

## Accessibility

It's important to note that animation can cause issues for some users, this
should be taken into consideration when adding page transitions. Scaling and
panning animations can be particularly problematic for users with vestibular
disorders, and can cause dizziness and nausea.

Users can set their motion preferences at the operating system level, and it's
possible to check this preference using the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media
query. The simplest approach is to disable all view transitions if the user has
`prefers-reduced-motion` turned on:

```css
@supports (view-transition-name: none) {
	@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {
		::view-transition-group(*),
		::view-transition-old(*),
		::view-transition-new(*) {
			animation: none;
		}
	}
}
```

Bear in mind that motion can sometimes be an essential part of user experience.
If a user has `prefers-reduced-motion` turned on, it's sometimes better to
replace problematic animations such as scaling or panning with transitions such
as opacity fades, which are less likely to cause issues. You can read more about
this in my article
"[Making motion accessible: how to respect users' motion preferences](/blog/making-motion-accessible-prefers-reduced-motion)".

## Debugging the transitions

Something super cool that came in really useful whilst building the view
transitions for my website was Chrome's animation drawer in the developer tools.
It allows you to capture and replay animations, so you can debug them in slow
motion and make sure they're pixel perfect. You can learn more about it in the
[Chrome Dev Tools docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/animations).

## Conclusion

In the past, full page transitions have been painful to build, but the View
Transitions API now makes it super easy. Just by adding a few lines of code you
get so much for free, and I'm looking forward to seeing how things develop as
the API becomes more widely adopted. The future of motion on the web looks
bright!
