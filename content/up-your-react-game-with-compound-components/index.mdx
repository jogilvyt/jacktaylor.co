One of the biggest challenges as a UI developer is making your code reusable
whilst also keeping it clean and maintainable. I'm sure this pattern is
familiar:

- You get some designs for a component that you build, test, and deploy.
- Everything is looking great. A new feature comes along that has similar (but
  slightly different) functionality. You add a prop or some conditional logic to
  your component to handle this new use case, which works, but things are
  starting to get a little messy.
- The original feature that you built the component for now has some new
  requirements and you need to update the code. But you are worried about
  breaking the other instances of your component and it's getting difficult to
  write tests to cover all the logic.

This (or something like it) happens all the time. So what can we do to avoid
getting into a sticky situation?

## Compund components

Compound components are where a number of subcomponents work together with a
shared state to do something useful. That was a bit of a mouthful, so let's have
a look at an example:

```jsx
const Modal = ({ header, body, onClose }) => {
	return (
		<div className="Modal">
			<div className="Modal-Header">
				<h2>{header}</h2>
			</div>
			<div className="Modal-Body">
				<p>{body}</p>
			</div>
			<div className="Modal-Actions">
				<button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}

export default Modal
```

We have a simple modal component that takes a `header`, `body`, and an `onClose`
prop. At this point, the modal works nicely, but it's not particularly flexible.
If a requirement came along to add a "Confirm" button or to be able to pass JSX
to be rendered in the body, this would start to cause problems. You could put
some additional logic in to check what's being passed down, but as the
complexity grows, the component will become unmaintainable:

```jsx
const Modal = ({ header, body, onClose, onConfirm, confirmButtonText }) => {
	const renderBody = () => {
		if (typeof body === 'string') {
			return <p>body</p>
		}

		return body
	}

	return (
		<div className="Modal">
			<div className="Modal-Header">
				<h2>{header}</h2>
			</div>
			<div className="Modal-Body">{renderBody()}</div>
			<div className="Modal-Actions">
				<button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
				{onConfirm && (
					<button onClick={onConfirm}>
						{confirmButtonText ? confirmButtonText : 'Confirm'}
					</button>
				)}
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}

export default Modal
```

As you can see, we have had to put several checks in so that we render the
components properly, and as the requirements grow, this will only get messier.

So let's have a look at how we could do this with compound components:

```jsx
const Modal = ({ children }) => {
	return (
		<div className="Modal">
			<div className="Modal-content">{children}</div>
		</div>
	)
}

const ModalHeader = ({ children }) => {
	return (
		<div className="Modal-header">
			<h2>{children}</h2>
		</div>
	)
}

const ModalBody = ({ children }) => {
	return <div className="Modal-body">{children}</div>
}

const ModalActions = ({ children }) => {
	return <div className="Modal-actions">{children}</div>
}

// This is optional, but shows the explicit link between the components
Modal.Header = ModalHeader
Modal.Body = ModalBody
Modal.Actions = ModalActions

export default Modal
```

In this example, we have set each part of the modal up as its own component that
takes children. We then assign each component as a static property to the
`Modal` component. This part is completely optional, but I like this pattern, as
it shows that the components are explicitly linked, and reinforces the concept
that subcomponents, such as `Modal.Header`, should only be rendered inside a
`Modal`.

We can then use it like this:

```jsx
const App = () => {
	const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false)

	return (
		<div className="App">
			<h1>Try opening the modal</h1>
			<button onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(true)}>Open the modal</button>

			{isModalOpen ? (
				<Modal>
					<Modal.Header>This is a modal</Modal.Header>
					<Modal.Body>
						<p>Inside it is some information</p>
						<p>You can render whatever JSX you want in here</p>
					</Modal.Body>
					<Modal.Actions>
						<button onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(false)}>Cancel</button>
						<button onClick={() => alert('You have accepted!')}>Accept</button>
					</Modal.Actions>
				</Modal>
			) : null}
		</div>
	)
}
```

We access the subcomponents using the dot notation (e.g. `Modal.Header`) and we
can now pass down whatever we want as children with any functionality we might
need. This means our modal component is significantly more flexible — all the
styling and formatting is handled internally, and any other logic is just passed
down as children — but the actual modal code is also massively simplified too.

## Taking It a Step Further

Part of my earlier definition of a compound component was that "a number of
subcomponents work together with a shared state to do something useful." The
modal example is already useful in that it abstracts all the styles into one
place but allows us flexibility as to what we pass down to it, but the
subcomponents (e.g. `Modal.Header` or `Modal.Actions`) don't share any state
between them.

So how could we implicitly share state between the subcomponents? Let's take a
look at another example:

```jsx
import { createContext, useState, useContext, useMemo } from 'react'

const SelectListContext = createContext()

const SelectList = ({ children }) => {
	const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

	const contextValue = useMemo(
		() => ({
			isOpen,
			setIsOpen,
		}),
		[isOpen],
	)

	return (
		<SelectListContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
			<div className="SelectList">{children}</div>
		</SelectListContext.Provider>
	)
}

const useSelectListContext = () => {
	const context = useContext(SelectListContext)
	if (!context) {
		throw new Error(
			`SelectList components cannot be rendered outside the SelectList component`,
		)
	}
	return context
}

const SelectListToggle = ({ children }) => {
	const { setIsOpen } = useSelectListContext()

	return (
		<div
			onClick={() => setIsOpen(prevOpen => !prevOpen)}
			className="SelectList-Toggle"
		>
			{children} ▾
		</div>
	)
}

const SelectListDropdown = ({ children }) => {
	const { isOpen } = useSelectListContext()

	return isOpen ? (
		<div className="SelectList-Dropdown" style={{ position: 'absolute' }}>
			{children}
		</div>
	) : null
}

const SelectListItem = ({ children, onClick }) => {
	const { setIsOpen } = useSelectListContext()

	return (
		<div
			className="SelectList-Item"
			onClick={() => {
				setIsOpen(false)
				onClick()
			}}
		>
			{children}
		</div>
	)
}

SelectList.Toggle = SelectListToggle
SelectList.Dropdown = SelectListDropdown
SelectList.Item = SelectListItem

export default SelectList
```

There's a lot going on here, so let's break it down. We are building a select
list that should work in a similar way to an HTML `select`:

- First, we create a context using React's `createContext`. This is how we will
  share the state between our subcomponents.
- We then set up our `SelectList` component that creates a context provider and
  passes the `isOpen` state to the provider's value. We will now have access to
  this state (and the `setIsOpen` state setter) in all the consumers of the
  `SelectList` provider.
- We create a `useSelectListContext` Hook so we don't have to repeatedly call
  `useContext(SelectListContext)`.
- We then set up each of our subcomponents (`SelectListToggle`,
  `SelectListDropdown`, and `SelectListItem`) that render out the options and
  handle opening, closing, and selecting an item.
- Finally, we assign each of the components as a static property on the
  `SelectList` component so that we can access them using the dot notation when
  we come to use it.

This is how we would use it:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

import SelectList from './SelectList'

const options = ['Apples', 'Pears', 'Lemons', 'Limes']

function App() {
	const [selectedValue, setSelectedValue] = useState(options[0])

	return (
		<div className="App">
			<SelectList>
				<SelectList.Toggle>{selectedValue}</SelectList.Toggle>
				<SelectList.Dropdown>
					{options.map((option, index) => (
						<SelectList.Item
							key={index}
							onClick={() => setSelectedValue(option)}
						>
							{option}
						</SelectList.Item>
					))}
				</SelectList.Dropdown>
			</SelectList>
		</div>
	)
}
```

We are mapping through our list of options and rendering them as a
`SelectList.Item`. What's great about this is that we could pass anything down
as a child to our list of options (e.g. icons or more comprehensive JSX). We
have complete flexibility as to what gets rendered inside of the `SelectList`,
but we don't have to worry about handling its "open" state.

## Conclusion

Compound components are an incredibly powerful way of making your code cleaner
and more reusable. This pattern is commonly used in UI libraries (e.g.
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)), as it gives developers complete
flexibility over what they render in a component whilst abstracting away all the
repetitive logic.

Hopefully, you will find it useful in your own projects and avoid falling into
the all-too-familiar pattern of refactoring hell when new requirements come up!
