Motion is a really important part of good user interface design. It can help
inform users of a narrative around the actions they're taking, draw attention to
specific parts of a UI and guide users in their decision making, and help users
identify relationships between elements. For me, it's often the thing that
differentiates an average product from a great one.

	If you're interested in learning more about motion in user interface design,
	Issara Willenskomer's article "[Creating Usability with Motion: The UX in
	Motion
	Manifesto](https://medium.com/ux-in-motion/creating-usability-with-motion-the-ux-in-motion-manifesto-a87a4584ddc)"
	is worth a read. It goes into depth about why motion is important, and how it
	can enhance the usability of our applications.

However, motion can cause significant issues for some users. People with
vestibular disorders can experience a whole host of nasty side effects from
certain types of animation - discomfort, dizziness, even nausea and sickness.
And according to [vestibular.org](http://vestibular.org), as many as 35% of
adults aged 40 years or older in the United States have experienced some form of
vestibular dysfunction.

As well as this, some people can find certain types of motion distracting or
overwhelming, and flashing or flickering animations can trigger epileptic
episodes. If we're aiming to increase the usability of our apps, it's important
to consider all of these users when we build motion into our interfaces.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) on motion

Before getting stuck in, it's worth pointing out that there are a couple of
success criteria relating to motion in the WCAG 2.1 guidelines. These are:

1. [2.2.2 Pause, stop, hide (level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html#seizures-and-physical-reactions) -
   "For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts
   automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in
   parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause,
   stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an
   activity where it is essential."
2. [2.3.3 Animation from interactions (level AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html) -
   "Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the
   animation is essential to the functionality or the information being
   conveyed."

It's worth noting that meeting these requirements won't necessarily guarantee
that your app is usable for people with disabilities, but it does provide a good
indication that you're moving in the right direction.

So how can we make sure that motion is accessible?

## `prefers-reduced-motion`

It's possible for users to set their operating system preferences to "reduce
motion", and this preference is available to your application in the web browser
through a media query. A simple example would look like this:

```css
.animated-element {
	animation: slide-in 1s ease-in-out;
	/* Other styles... */
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
	/* Styles for when motion is reduced */
	.animated-element {
		animation: none;
	}
}
```

Sometimes it can help be a helpful mental model to think of motion as opt-in
rather than opt-out - so we define our basic styles, and then add some
additional styles when a user has not explicitly stated that they want to reduce
motion:

```css
.animated-element {
	/* Animation properties can just be omitted */
	/* Other styles... */
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
	/* Styles for when motion is enabled */
	.animated-element {
		animation: slide-in 1s ease-in-out;
	}
}
```

<Callout>
	`prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference;` is the default setting, and lets us
	know that a user has not explicitly turned "reduce motion" on.
</Callout>

It's also possible to detect this media query in JavaScript using
`window.matchMedia`:

```js
const motionQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')

if (motionQuery.matches) {
	// Motion is reduced
} else {
	// Motion is enabled
}
```

And if you're using React, you can put this into a hook:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export function useReducedMotion() {
	// Reduce motion by default - especially relevant for SSR where the window object
	// is not available when the component renders on the server
	const [matches, setMatches] = useState(true)

	useEffect(() => {
		const motionQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')
		setMatches(motionQuery.matches)

		// Add an event listener to update state if motion preference changes
		const handleMotionQueryChange = () => {
			setMatches(motionQuery.matches)
		}

		motionQuery.addEventListener('change', handleMotionQueryChange)

		// Clean up the event listener
		return () => {
			motionQuery.removeEventListener('change', handleMotionQueryChange)
		}
	}, [])

	return matches
}
```

<Callout>
	JavaScript animation libraries will often expose a hook you can use to detect
	whether a user has `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled. For example,
	`framer-motion` exposes the [`useReducedMotion`
	hook](https://www.framer.com/motion/use-reduced-motion/), which you can use in
	the same way as the example above.
</Callout>

## Testing `prefers-reduced-motion`

Now that we can detect whether a user has enabled `prefers-reduced-motion`, it's
a good idea to test what happens when we switch it on ourselves.

You can enable the setting at the operating system level - for example, on MacOS
Sonoma, open System Settings, go to Accessibility, then Display, and toggle on
"Reduce motion".

It's also possible to emulate the media query in your browser. Google Chrome
allows you to toggle the `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce;` media feature on and
off through the developer tools - check out the instructions in the
"[Emulate CSS media feature `prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/rendering/emulate-css#emulate_css_media_feature_prefers-reduced-motion)"
section of the documentation.

<Callout>
	It's quite interesting to turn on `prefers-reduced-motion` and browse some
	sites you're familiar with, to see how they handle it. It can provide you with
	some inspiration for how to preserve the usability benefits of motion in an
	accessible way.

## Problematic types of motion

We know that motion can cause problems for some users, but it's important to
note that this only applies to certain types of motion.

As a general rule, it's best to avoid flickering or blinking animations
(particularly relevant to the WCAG Success Criterion 2.2.2 "Pause, Stop, Hide").
These can be distracting, and in some cases can trigger epileptic episodes. I
would also say (subjectively) that these are pretty annoying for _all_ users -
so I'd recommend avoiding them even when users don't explicitly have reduced
motion turned on.

Scaling, zooming, spinning or positional animations can be particularly
problematic for users with vestibular disorders. These can trigger feelings of
motion sickness - and if you've ever been seasick, you'll know just how
unpleasant this can be.

However, some types of motion are less likely to cause problems. Colour
transitions and opacity fades tend not to be vestibular triggers, so something
like transitioning the background colour of an element on hover is generally
safe. Furthermore, these transitions are often essential for conveying meaning
in user interactions - for example, when changing a button from _enabled_ to
_disabled_.

## Keep motion where it's essential

Where motion plays an important role in enhancing the usability of an interface,
you should aim to keep it present, but in an accessible way. This means
replacing problematic motion with transitions that won't cause unintended
consequences.

As an example, let's imagine we have a drawer component which slides in from the
side of the screen when it opens. This transition is important, as it shows the
user that the context of the screen they're looking at has changed. However, a
large element changing position like this can be a vestibular trigger. So if a
user has prefers-reduced-motion set, you could replace this with an opacity fade
between the closed and open states. This would preserve the usability benefits
of applying the transition, but in a less problematic way.

<Callout>
	If you're on a Mac, try turning on reduced motion and swiping between
	desktops. You'll see something similar to this, where the slide animation is
	replaced with an opacity fade
</Callout>

If you're ever unsure, it's always best to test your transitions with real users
who browse your application with `prefers-reduced-motion` set, if possible. This
is the only way to truly know if your app is actually usable, rather than just
conforming to WCAG standards - and is best practice for user interface
development as a whole.

## Conclusion

Building really good user interfaces is a pretty daunting task. There's already
so much to consider in order to get an app working across every browser, screen
size and device, let alone thinking about screenreaders, different input
modalities, zoom levels... Motion is a small part of all of this, and it's easy
to overlook altogether, or sprinkle about randomly as an afterthought.

But getting it right really does elevate an experience from being just average,
to being something special. And making sure it works for everyone is an
essential part of that. We should allow users to interact with our application
in the way that suits them best, and still provide a great experience - and
accessible motion can play a big part in that.
