If you have ever worked with `useEffect` in React, you have probably come across
the following lint warning:

```bash
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency.
Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```

Sometimes the fix is as simple as just adding the required dependency, but often
this results in some pretty unexpected behaviour that leaves you scratching your
head. Worse yet, your code might get stuck in an infinite loop.

So how can we deal with this warning properly rather than just ignoring it?

With the advent of React Hooks, `useEffect` has been seen as a way of handling
lifecycle methods that were previously accessible on component classes (e.g.
`componentDidMount` or `componentWillUpdate`). The reality is a little subtler
and requires a shift in thinking away from object-oriented programming and
towards functional programming.

[According to Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function)

> A pure function is a function that has the following properties:
>
> 1. Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with
>    local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or
>    input streams from I/O devices).
> 2. Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables,
>    non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).

In the context of React, a pure functional component is one that takes some
props (arguments) and renders some content. You can be sure that rendering the
component with the same props will always output the same HTML. The component
won't have any internal state and won't interact with or modify any external
variables.

This is great for presentational components, but in the real world, there will
be cases where we do need side effects (e.g. to load some data from an API or to
persist some state between renders). This is where React Hooks come in.

So what does `useEffect` really do? Well, as the name implies, it's a way of
handling side effects. It takes an array of dependencies, and if any of those
dependencies have changed since the last render, it runs the function you
provide it. This means we can handle things like loading data from an API only
when we want to — not every time the component rerenders.

	If you are interested in how it works under the hood, React relies on the
	order of the Hooks in your component to know how to handle side effects
	between renders, which is why you can only call Hooks at the top level. You
	can read more about this in the [React
	documentation](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks).
</Callout>

However, this dependency array often causes problems. If we want to run an
effect once on mount, you can use an empty dependency array. For example, say we
want to use `axios` to fetch some data when the component renders:

```jsx
const Item = ({ params }) => {
	const [data, setData] = useState(null)

	useEffect(() => {
		const res = axios.get('/some/url', { params })
		setData(res)
	}, [])
}
```

This is where you run into the lint warning:

```bash
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'params'.
Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```

What does this warning mean? Well, the code inside the `useEffect` is relying on
the params variable to make the API request. When the component re-renders, the
value of params inside the `useEffect` could potentially be out of date. Since
the effect has only run once, it will only have the value of params at the very
first render.

You might be wondering if this is really a problem, aside from the annoying lint
warnings that will show up in your console. In this instance, your code will
work as expected and there aren't any issues. However, not including the correct
dependencies has the potential to introduce subtle bugs that can be a nightmare
to solve.

In his post (A Complete Guide to
useEffect)[https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/#dont-lie-to-react-about-dependencies]
(which is well worth a read), Dan Abramov uses the example of a counter app with
an interval:

```jsx
const Counter = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

	useEffect(() => {
		const id = setInterval(() => {
			setCount(count + 1)
		}, 1000)
		return () => clearInterval(id)
	}, [])

	return <h1>{count}</h1>
}
```

You only want to set the interval running once, but as your effect doesn't have
`count` as part of its dependency array, it will only ever have the default
value (in this case, 0). What you will see is a 0 that is incremented to 1 after
a second and then never changes because we are setting the `count` to be `0 + 1`
on each instance of the interval.

As Dan Abramov says:

> Don't lie to React about dependencies.

So, the first common issue with `useEffect` is that you only want to run it once
on mount but are running into lint warnings. There is another issue, though,
that we can use our example to illustrate.

You might try to solve the lint warning by adding `params` to the dependency
array of the `useEffect`:

```jsx
const Item = ({ params }) => {
	const [data, setData] = useState(null)

	useEffect(() => {
		const res = axios.get('/some/url', { params })
		setData(res)
	}, [params])
}
```

In theory, this should work. The `params` don't change, so it should only run
the `useEffect` once on mount. However, if `params` is an object, you will find
that the `useEffect` will run every time the component re-renders — even if
`params` is the same.

This happens because JavaScript doesn't handle object equality:

```js
{ some: 'value' } === { some: 'value' } = false
```

When `useEffect` checks to see if any of the dependencies have changed, `params`
will never be equal to its previous value, so the code inside the effect will
run.

This can end up with our code getting stuck in some pretty nasty infinite loops.
So how can we solve these two problems?

## Solving Issues With the Dependency Array

As always, the first thing to do when you encounter an issue like this is to
take a step back and see if you've coded yourself into a corner. There are often
simple solutions to a problem if you take a bit of time to refactor what you've
done. For example, should you really be making an API call in a component or
should that code be decoupled and the data passed down as props?

Taking some time to step away and get some perspective means you can often avoid
problems like this altogether.

If you've done this and there's no alternative but to use a `useEffect`, then
it's time to reach for `useRef`.

### Refs to the rescue

React's `useRef` Hook gives us a way of storing a mutable value between renders.
From the
[React `useRef` docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef#referencing-a-value-with-a-ref):

> `useRef` returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to
> the initial value you provided. On the next renders, `useRef` will return the
> same object. You can change its current property to store information and read
> it later.

We can use a ref to keep track of whether some code has run or not. If not, then
run it. If it has, then skip it. With our example, this would look something
like this:

```jsx
const Item = ({ params }) => {
	const hasFetchedData = useRef(false)
	const [data, setData] = useState(null)

	useEffect(() => {
		if (!hasFetchedData.current) {
			const res = axios.get('/some/url', { params })
			setData(res)
			hasFetchedData.current = true
		}
	}, [params])
}
```

Inside the `useEffect`, we check to see if `hasFetchedData.current` is `false`.
If it is, then we hit the API and update the ref to be `true`. That means the
next time the component renders, `hasFetchedData.current` will be `true` and we
won't make the API call. The `useEffect` will still run on every render, but the
API call will only run once.

In effect, we have a "gate". We should only run the code inside the `useEffect`
when certain conditions have been met.

### Dealing with non-primitives

As outlined above, non-primitives (i.e. objects or arrays) in the dependency
array will cause `useEffect` to run on every render, as JavaScript is unable to
determine object equality. To get around this, we will need to do some form of
deep comparison between the new and old values when the `useEffect` runs.

This means we'll need to keep a reference to the previous value of the
dependency so we can compare it to the new value when the `useEffect` runs and
checks whether or not it's changed. Once again, refs come to the rescue. We can
use `useRef` to store the previous value and update it inside the `useEffect` if
the value has changed (which we can check by using some kind of deep comparison
function).

Say we want to do something similar to the example above, but we want to fetch
the data every time the params value changes. Just passing params in the
dependency array will mean the `useEffect` runs on every re-render, which is not
what we want. Instead, we can do this:

```jsx
const Item = ({ params }) => {
	const prevParams = useRef(params)
	const [data, setData] = useState(null)

	useEffect(() => {
		if (!isDeepEqual(prevParams.current, params)) {
			const res = axios.get('/some/url', { params })
			setData(res)
			prevParams.current = params
		}
	}, [params])
}
```

Note: In this example, we are using `fast-deep-equal`, but any deep comparison
function would work.

Let's break this down:

1. First, we set up a ref to track the previous `params` value.
2. In the `useEffect`, we do a deep comparison between `prevParams.current` and
   params and only make the API call if they're not equal.
3. Finally, we update our `prevParams.current` ref to the new `params` value.

This means the API call will now only run when `params` changes.

## Conclusion

Working with `useEffect` is one of the things that has highlighted how much of a
paradigm shift Hooks have been for React. It really forces you to think about
what's going on under the hood, and this can often be frustrating when it slows
down the process of implementing what should be a simple piece of functionality.
To quote Dan Abramov's article again when talking about starting out with Hooks:

> There won't be much to learn. In fact, we'll spend most of our time
> unlearning.

However, once you really start "thinking in Hooks", you will reap the benefits.
Taking the time to truly understand what's going on means you will ultimately
write cleaner and more performant code.

These lint rules exist for a reason, so we should all do our best to follow them
— and stop lying to React about dependencies.
