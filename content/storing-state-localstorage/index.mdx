Storing state in `localStorage` is a great way of improving user experience, so
that a user can pick up where they left off when returning to an application.
With React hooks, it's super easy to abstract this functionality so it can be
reused anywhere. In this article, I am going to go over the implementation, and
also show you how you can write tests for it using Jest and React Testing
Library.

We are going to be building a good old counter app, and storing the count
variable in `localStorage` so the value is persisted between sessions.

**TL;DR** — you can find the final code for the project in
[this Github repo](https://github.com/jogilvyt/counter-with-localstorage).

## Simple counter app

Let's start by getting a simple counter app working. We have the following code:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Counter</h1>
			<p>Number: {count}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-1</button>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+1</button>
		</div>
	)
}

export default App
```

We have a **count** variable stored in state, and a decrement and increment
button which decreases or increases the number. Now for the fun part!

## Reading from `localStorage`

The localStorage API exposes four methods: `getItem()`, `setItem()`,
`removeItem()` and `clear()`. We will want to use `getItem()` when we initialise
the component to load in any previously persisted data, and `setItem()` to
update the `localStorage` when the count variable changes.

To do this, we can take advantage of `useState` "lazy initialisation". All this
means is that we can pass a function to `useState` which returns the initial
state value, rather than passing the initial value straight in. This means we
can check if there is anything stored in `localStorage` and initialise the state
to that value; otherwise initialise it to the default value.

For our code, this will look something like this:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {
		const persistedValue = window.localStorage.getItem('count')
		return persistedValue !== null ? JSON.parse(persistedValue) : 0
	})

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Counter</h1>
			<p>Number: {count}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-1</button>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+1</button>
		</div>
	)
}

export default App
```

So, when `useState` is initialised, it checks to see if `localStorage` contains
any items with the key `count`. If so, the state is initialised to that value —
otherwise, the initial state is set to `0`.

## Writing to `localStorage`

At this point, we are reading the state from `localStorage` but we never set it.
You can click the buttons and increase or decrease the count, but when you
refresh the page, it will get set back to the default value of `0`.

To address this, we need to call `setItem()` when the `count` value changes.
There are a couple of ways of doing this — for example, you could add to the
`onClick` functions on the buttons:

```jsx
<button
	onClick={() => {
		setCount(count + 1)
		localStorage.setItem('count', count + 1)
	}}
>
	+1
</button>
```

However, in a real-world application where the state might be being updated from
lots of places, this can quickly spaghetti and get out of hand. A simpler
solution is to use `useEffect` to update `localStorage` every time the `count`
variable changes:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

function App() {
	const key = 'count'

	const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {
		const persistedValue = window.localStorage.getItem(key)
		return persistedValue !== null ? JSON.parse(persistedValue) : 0
	})

	useEffect(() => {
		window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(count))
	}, [count])

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Counter</h1>
			<p>Number: {count}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-1</button>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+1</button>
		</div>
	)
}

export default App
```

The useEffect has count as a dependency — this means every time the count
changes, useEffect will run and update localStorage with the new value.

<Callout>
	As a side note, this is exactly what `useEffect` is designed for - to handle
	"side effects" (such as mutating `localStorage`) in our React components.
	Check out "[Stop lying to React about missing
	dependecies](/blog/stop-lying-to-react-about-missing-dependencies)" if you
	want to learn more about how `useEffect` works under the hood.
</Callout>

At this stage, we have a fully functioning app which stores the `count` in
`localStorage` and persists it between sessions. This is great! However, with
custom React hooks, we can abstract this code to make it reusable, rather than
being tightly coupled to the counter functionality. This also makes the code
more testable . Decoupling logic like this from our components means we can test
code in isolation rather than having the `localStorage` logic closely linked to
the counter logic. More on that later!

## Creating a custom React hook

We can abstract the `localStorage` state logic into its own hook:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const useStateWithLocalStorage = (defaultValue, key) => {
	const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
		const persistedValue = window.localStorage.getItem(key)

		return persistedValue !== null ? JSON.parse(persistedValue) : defaultValue
	})

	useEffect(() => {
		window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value))
	}, [key, value])

	return [value, setValue]
}

export default useStateWithLocalStorage
```

We have pretty much the same code that we had in the counter component, but we
have made it a bit more generic so that it can be reused in any context. It
takes the `defaultValue` and `key` as arguments, and listens for changes to the
value inside the `useEffect` to update `localStorage` using `setItem()`.

To use it inside our counter component:

```jsx
import useStateWithLocalStorage from '../hooks/useStateWithLocalStorage'

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useStateWithLocalStorage(0, 'count')

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Counter</h1>
			<p>Number: {count}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-1</button>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+1</button>
		</div>
	)
}

export default App
```

This code is a bit tidier than what we had before, and it's now super easy to
replace a traditional `useState` hook with a `useStateWithLocalStorage` hook —
you just need to pass the local storage key as the second argument, and the
state will be persisted between sessions.

## Testing

We can use
[`react-hooks-testing-library`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library)
to test our implementation of `useStateWithLocalStorage`:

```jsx
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks'

import useStateWithLocalStorage from './useStateWithLocalStorage'

const TEST_KEY = 'key'
const TEST_VALUE = { test: 'test' }

describe('useStateWithLocalStorage', () => {
	it('should set localStorage with default value', () => {
		renderHook(() => useStateWithLocalStorage(TEST_VALUE, TEST_KEY))
		expect(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(TEST_KEY))).toEqual(TEST_VALUE)
	})

	it('should set the default value from localStorage if it exists', () => {
		// set the localStorage to the test value
		localStorage.setItem(TEST_KEY, JSON.stringify(TEST_VALUE))

		// initialise with an empty object
		const { result } = renderHook(() => useStateWithLocalStorage({}, TEST_KEY))

		// check that the value is what is stored in localStorage (and not an empty object)
		const [value] = result.current
		expect(value).toEqual(TEST_VALUE)

		// expect value to be taken from localStorage (rather than empty object)
		expect(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(TEST_KEY))).toEqual(TEST_VALUE)
	})

	it('should update localStorage when state changes', () => {
		// initialise with test object
		const { result } = renderHook(() =>
			useStateWithLocalStorage(TEST_VALUE, TEST_KEY),
		)

		const [, setValue] = result.current

		// set the state to something new
		const newValue = { anotherValue: 'Some value' }
		act(() => {
			setValue(newValue)
		})

		// localStorage should have updated to new value
		expect(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(TEST_KEY))).toEqual(newValue)
	})
})
```

Let's break this down. Our `useStateWithLocalStorage` hook needs to do three
things:

1. it needs to initialise the `localStorage` state with the default argument
   that gets passed in;
2. if there is already a value stored in `localStorage`, it should initialise
   the state to that value;
3. when we update the state, it should update the value stored in
   `localStorage`.

### Initialising the state with the default argument

The first test, "should set `localStorage` with default value", deals with
requirement one. We use react-hooks-testing-library's renderHook to initialise
our hook with a test value and a test `localStorage` key, and then check that
the value stored in `localStorage` matches what we passed in.

### Initialising the state to the value in localStorage

The second test, "should set the default value from `localStorage` if it
exists", checks that the second requirement is met. We set the `localStorage` to
the test value before rendering our hook. We then initialise our state with an
empty object, pulling the result from react-hooks-testing-library's `renderHook`
method. Finally, we deconstruct the state from `result.current` to check that it
matches the `localStorage` state rather than an empty object, and check that
`localStorage` itself hasn't been updated.

### Updating the localStorage state

The last test, "should update `localStorage` when state changes", deals with the
third requirement. We initialise our hook, and this time pull the `setValue`
function from `result.current` so that we can update the state. We then check
that `localStorage` has been updated with the new state value.

We can also write some tests to check that the counter integrates with
`localStorage` properly:

```jsx
it('should initialise with the value stored in localStorage', () => {
	// set the localStorage to a value other than 0
	localStorage.setItem('count', 15)

	// render the App and check it initialises to the value in localStorage
	render(<App />)
	screen.getByText(/Number: 15/)

	// click the increment button and check the localStorage is updated
	const incrementButton = screen.getByText(/\+1/)
	fireEvent.click(incrementButton)
	screen.getByText(/Number: 16/)
	expect(localStorage.getItem('count')).toBe('16')
})
```

Here, we set the `localStorage` count to an initial value of 15, then render our
component and click on the increment button. We can then check that the count
itself has increased, and also that the value stored in `localStorage` matches.

It's also a good idea to clear `localStorage` between tests to ensure that each
test is fully isolated:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
	localStorage.clear()
})
```

Note that if you are using an older version of jest/jsdom, you will need to mock
`localStorage` to get it to work when you run your tests. In your
`setupTests.js` file, you can add the following:

```js
class LocalStorageMock {
	constructor() {
		this.store = {}
	}

	clear() {
		this.store = {}
	}

	getItem(key) {
		return this.store[key] || null
	}

	setItem(key, value) {
		this.store[key] = value
	}

	removeItem(key) {
		delete this.store[key]
	}
}

global.localStorage = new LocalStorageMock()
```

This creates a barebones implementation of `localStorage` so we can run the
tests above and check that everything is working as expected.

To sum up, using `localStorage` is a great way of improving user experience by
storing state between sessions, and by using custom React hooks, you can do it
in a reusable, maintainable and testable way.
